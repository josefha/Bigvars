The idea and requirements of what the distributed library is started with other implementations of distributed data types. The goal is to give the programmer an easy and efficient tool for creating parallel and concurrent programs. It should not be harder to work with big amounts of data in the library environment, preferable easier then with normal data types such as arrays. The features of library includes not only abstraction of the parallelism and basic functionality from the normal data types, it will have more advanced functionality to automate some frequently used tasks. \\

The basic concepts of all data types in the library is that all data contained by the data type is divided between many different processes and therefor can be run concurrent and parallel by default. The library will provide an answer for how data could be divided and the user can then optimise the sizing if necessary. Because of the importance to facilitate working with big amounts of data focus on friendly programmer level operations are more important than a super efficient implementation.
