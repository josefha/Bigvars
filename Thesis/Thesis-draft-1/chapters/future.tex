\section{Syntax Support}
All ready in the discussion of the specs of this bachelor thesis implementing syntax support in the Encore Language for this library was considered. Here is one example to describe what that could look like. If an distributed hash table object was created, the programmer should be able to call a method from the inserted object directly on that distributed hash table and it would automatically apply the function on all values. Currently to do this the programmer would have to create and anonymous function and insert it as argument to a specific method.

\begin{itemize}
\item \blindtext Example with no syntax support, where raiseSalary() is a method in the Employee class.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
// Creates a Bigvar with Employees objects.
var AllEmployees = new Bigvar[Employees](employees_list)

//Call the method raiseSalary and on every Empolyee object 
AllEmployees.apply(fun(e:Empolyee) => e.raiseSalay(0.04))
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item \blindtext Example with syntax support from the Encore Language. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
var AllEmployees = new Bigvar[Employee](employees_list) 
AllEmployees.raiseSalary(0.04) 
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Future Development}
There are a lot of work that could be done to improve the current implementation of the distributed data types. Next up could be to add more functionality, optimize the current implementation and add support for more data types.

\section{Bestow and Atomic Operations}
There are many different ways one could implement distributed data types beside how it was done for this thesis. During the same time period as of writing of this thesis another bachelor student was working on implementing Bestow and Atomic operations into the Encore Language. \\
